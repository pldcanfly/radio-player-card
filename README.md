# radio-player-card


Just a simple very statically thrown together card for home-assistant.

Use-case for me was that i wanted a place to quickly choose my most-listened to radio-stations from a single place. Home-Assistant it self was a pain with that, especially with how minimalistic I wanted it to look.

Might make it pretty, and nicely configurable if I feel like it.
